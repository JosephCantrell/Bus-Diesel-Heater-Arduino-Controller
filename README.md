# Chinese-Heater-Temperature-Addon
Addon for chinese diesel heaters to enable better (or different) temperature control

This is not my code. I have only modified it to work with an independent air valve system to control where hot/cold air is being moved around inside of my house

To connect the arduino to the Diesel heater, you must connect D11 to the signal wire (typically blue) and a gnd connection to the ground of the controller (black)

The code works completely automatically to monitor and control the diesel heater. 

My additions add valve controls and temperature sensors to determine what valves should open or close.
